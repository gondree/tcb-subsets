# TCB Subset Formal Model
Event B model for TCB Subset Concepts, as described by Shockley & Schell [SS87].

This software model was developed with and type-checked using Rodin (v 3.0.1-5326174). All theorems were proven using Rodin's ProB and Atelier B provers.

### To View
The simplest way to view the model and start to check or use the axioms related to its properties is to import the files into a new Rodin project. Clone the repository somewhere locally.

1. Install Rodin
2. File > New > Event B Project
3. File > Import & navigate to the cloned tcb-subsets project files and import these

### To Use
There is a ()to-be-released) technical report explaining how new machine abstractions can be related to TCB subset context abstractions via extends relationships, etc.
